                <ul>
                    <li>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</li>
                    <li>Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</li>
                    <li>Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</li>
                    <li>And summer's lease hath all too shorta date:</li>
                    <li>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</li>
                    <li>And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,</li>
                    <li>And every fair from fair sometime declines,</li>
                    <li>By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:</li>
                    <li>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</li>
                    <li>Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</li>
                    <li>Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</li>
                    <li>When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,</li>
                    <li>So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,</li>
                    <li>So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</li>
